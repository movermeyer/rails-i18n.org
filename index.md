<h1>Most of the world doesn't speak English.</h1>

That's where internationalization and localization come in. If you're a Rails developer and you'd like to make your app available (and understandable) for people all over the world, you're in luck: Rails has a great [i18n API](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html).

But the API built into Rails isn't the end of your internationalization story -- it's the beginning. As you dive into this tricky and challenging merging of code, language, and culture, you'll find numerous surprises and pitfalls. Stack Overflow [can help](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rails-i18n) once you're stuck -- but **this is what you should read** before you even begin.

Collected here are interviews with some of the world's leading Rails i18n developers. Core team members, people who created projects thousands of websites are using. Take a few moments, read their insights. You'll be glad you did.

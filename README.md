# rails-i18n.org

This is a community resource for Rails developers working on I18n. 

**Here's the thing:** Getting technical details on Rails I18n isn't hard. The [official guide](guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html) is superb, and Stack Overflow is full of useful answers. That's the easy part.

While it's easy to learn the technical nuts and bolts, that's only part of the picture. Rails-i18n.org aims to offer the other part: The humans behind the code. This is a resource where we'll publish interviews with the leading names in the Rails I18n world, giving their insights and thoughts on internationalization with Rails. 

While Stack Overflow (and the docs, to an extent) are about the myriad details that make up Rails I18n, this website is about the bird's eye view. Whether you're about to embark on your first Rails I18n project or are an old hand at this stuff, you'll probably get something from the interview published. And if you feel you already know it all -- I'd love to interview you!
